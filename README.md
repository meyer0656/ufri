# University of Florida Restaurant Inspections

This is a collection of records I was able to dig up for on-campus dining establishments. The records only go back one year. The state does not provide any details regarding the outcome of the inspections other than to state that the inspection was satisfactory or not. 

The Alachua County Health Department responded to my records request for all on-campus inspections dating back to 1/1/15 with a $42.00 quote. While there is no issue getting inspection details for restaurants in town, for some reason the county is making it costly and difficult to find out what's going on at UF.
I'll pay the tax and continue work on this project in the Fall.
